## Teaching Statement
I take a student-centred and evidence-based approach to teaching. My goal is to help students build strong foundations in economic theory and quantitative reasoning, while encouraging them to apply critical thinking to real-world issues. I have experience teaching both undergraduate and postgraduate students, and I aim to make econometrics and applied microeconomics accessible through clear explanations, structured exercises, and hands-on data work.  

I believe that effective learning happens when students feel supported and motivated. I provide clear guidance, step-by-step problem solving, and constructive feedback. In dissertation supervision, I focus on helping students develop research questions, empirical strategies, and academic writing skills. I am committed to inclusive teaching, engaging learners with different backgrounds and academic strengths, and helping them gain confidence in analytical methods.
