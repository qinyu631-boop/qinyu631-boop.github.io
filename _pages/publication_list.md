## Working Papers & Manuscripts

My research focuses on applied microeconomics, with interests in environmental and labour economics, migration, and the links between pollution, health, and socioeconomic outcomes. I use large-scale microdata, spatially matched environmental indicators, and causal inference techniques.

I currently have **five working papers** in progress. Titles and brief summaries are below.

### Breathing Easy, Retiring Early? Effects of Air Pollution on Retirement Age Expectations: Evidence from China  
*Job Market Paper*  

This paper examines how air pollution affects forward-looking labour supply decisions using longitudinal survey data linked with satellite-based PM2.5. The findings show that higher pollution is associated with earlier expected retirement, especially among rural workers, women, and individuals in physically demanding jobs. Health insurance coverage, financial security and local environmental infrastructure contribute to heterogeneous responses.

### Green Remittances: How Migration Shapes Green Behaviours in Rural China  
*Working Paper*  

This paper studies how migration influences environmental behaviour within households. Current migration may weaken daily green practices due to household separation, while return migration improves recycling and waste sorting through the transmission of norms acquired in urban areas. Social capital and green infrastructure amplify these effects.

### The Role of Air Pollution in Migration Decisions: Evidence from China  
*Working Paper*  

Using bidirectional urban migration flows and plausibly exogenous variation in pollution, this study shows that households respond to environmental risks when choosing destinations. Cleaner cities attract more migrants, particularly where social services and environmental regulation are stronger, indicating that environmental quality is an emerging driver of internal migration in developing economies.

### Immigration, Language Proficiency and Health: Evidence from OECD Countries  
*With Jackie Wahba and Michael Vlassopoulos — Manuscript in preparation*  

We study how language proficiency affects migrant children's social integration and mental health outcomes using harmonised international microdata. Stronger language skills are linked to fewer bullying incidents, improved peer relationships, and better psychosocial well-being. The results highlight the importance of language support programmes in promoting inclusion.

### When the Air Gets Dirty: Recruitment Responses in China’s Listed Companies  
*With Dingzhi Chen and Hanlei Huang — Manuscript in preparation*  

Using millions of online job postings matched with city-level environmental data, this paper examines how firms adjust recruitment strategies under worsening pollution. Firms reduce advertised wages for higher-skilled positions and increase recruitment of non-managerial roles, consistent with shifting labour demand and adaptation costs under environmental stress.
