## Publications & Working Papers

My research focuses on applied microeconomics, particularly environmental and labour economics, migration, and the links between pollution, health, and socioeconomic outcomes. I combine large-scale survey microdata with satellite-based environmental indicators and causal inference methods.

At this stage of my PhD, I have **five working papers** in progress. These papers examine how environmental shocks influence migration, employment behaviour, health outcomes, and firm responses in developing economies.

A full list of working papers or draft manuscripts is available upon request.  
If you are interested, please contact me at **Y.Qin@soton.ac.uk**.
