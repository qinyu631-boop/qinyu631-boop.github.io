I am **Yu Qin (秦宇)**, a PhD in Economics at the University of Southampton, supervised by **Professor Corrado Giulietti** and **Professor Jackie Wahba**. I work in applied microeconomics, with a focus on how environmental and social factors shape economic behaviour and wellbeing. My research spans environmental economics, labour economics, migration, and health, and I am particularly interested in how individuals and households respond to environmental and economic shocks.

Methodologically, my work combines large-scale microdata, satellite-based environmental measures, and econometric approaches using panel data and time-series variation. Much of my research focuses on developing economies—including China and the broader Global South—where questions of urban–rural transformation, poverty reduction, and sustainable development remain central. I am especially interested in the links between climate risks, inequality, and the resilience of individuals, communities, and firms facing environmental change.

I also have experience teaching econometrics, applied microeconomics, and introductory economics at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
