I am **Yu Qin (秦宇)**, a PhD in Economics at the University of Southampton. I work in applied microeconomics, with a focus on how environmental and social factors shape economic behaviour and wellbeing. My research interests span environmental economics, labour economics, migration, and health, and I am particularly interested in how individuals and households respond to environmental and economic shocks.

Methodologically, my work combines large-scale microdata, satellite-based environmental measures, and econometric approaches using panel data and time-series variation. Much of my research focuses on developing economies, including China and the broader Global South, where questions of urban–rural transformation, poverty reduction, and sustainable development remain central. I am especially interested in the links between climate risks, inequality, and the resilience of individuals, communities, and firms in the face of environmental change.

I also have experience in teaching econometrics, applied microeconomics, and introductory economics at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to email me at **Y.Qin@soton.ac.uk**.
