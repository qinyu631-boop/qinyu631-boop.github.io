I am **Yu Qin (秦宇)**, a PhD in Economics at the University of Southampton, supervised by **Professor Corrado Giulietti** and **Professor Jackie Wahba**. I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of environmental, labour, and health economics, with a particular focus on how individuals and households respond to environmental and economic shocks.

My research combines longitudinal microdata, satellite-based measures of air pollution and climate exposure, and econometric identification strategies using panel and time-series variation. Substantively, I study how pollution and climate risks affect labour market behaviour, human capital accumulation, migration decisions, and wellbeing. Much of my work focuses on China and the broader Global South, where issues of urban–rural transformation, inequality, and sustainable development are particularly salient.
